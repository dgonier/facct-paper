\begin{abstract}
High-stakes AI systems increasingly mediate access to credit, healthcare, and public benefits, yet affected parties often cannot see why a decision was made or meaningfully contest it. Even post hoc review of chain-of-thought traces from individual models can be incomplete or strategically misleading, thereby limiting accountability. We propose \foam{}, a pluralistic architecture for multi-agent language systems that treats explanation as a deliberative process where differentiated agents advance value- and role-specific arguments, a protocol structures rebuttal and evidence challenges, and a synthesis operator outputs both a recommendation and the surviving points of contention with sentence-level provenance. We implement \foam{} within a policy-debate case-generation system and evaluate it in a blinded tournament of 66 cases using automated multi-criteria evaluation and independent evidence verification. \foam{} outperforms human-expert and zero-shot model baselines on overall quality (81.7 vs. 70.1 and 50.6) and yields substantially higher perfect-evidence validation (76.2\% vs. 8.7\% and 0\%), thereby enabling downstream auditing and dispute resolution. We discuss how deliberative architectures can operationalize the requirements of transparency and contestation in emerging governance regimes and outline safeguards for dual-use persuasive capabilities.
